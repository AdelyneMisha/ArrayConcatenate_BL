# ArrayConcatenate_BL
Beginner's League challenge : Array Concatenation


This is a simple python program to concatenate two arrays. 
I've taken lists as arrays and its elements being integers.

Although there are many methods to concatenate arrays in python such as 
<ul>
  <li>using '+'</li>
  <li>using extend()</li>
  <li>manually concatenating array using list index and loops</li>
</ul>
Here, I've only used +
